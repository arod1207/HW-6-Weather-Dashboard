# HW-6-Weather-Dashboard
## This weather dashboard uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve data from different cities. It uses local storage to save the last user search. It shows the current forcast as well as a 5 day forcast that is updated in three hour intervals.  The uv index is highlighted in different colors to inform the user of the UV exposure for that day.
